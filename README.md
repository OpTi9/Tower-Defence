# TOWER DEFENSE PROJECT

This project represents the realization of a classic Tower Defense game in Unity game engine, following the instructions provided by my university professor. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did developing it.

## Game Objective

In this Tower Defense game, your goal is to withstand enemy waves for as long as possible. These enemy waves, infinite and programmed, will attempt to reach the exit located at one end of your game map. When one wave is entirely defeated, another appears, continuing this cycle indefinitely. Players are ranked on a leaderboard based on the number of waves they successfully fend off.

## Towers

You have the ability to build a variety of towers. Each tower type possesses certain bonuses against respective types of enemies. These towers can also carry certain effects; for instance, an Ice tower can have a slowing effect. Furthermore, towers can be upgraded to increase their attack power or enhance their effects, always in exchange for in-game currency.

Towers are constructed using an in-game currency, which is collected each time an enemy is defeated.

## Gameplay Mechanics

Tower placement on the field is entirely at the player's discretion. This placement will determine the path enemies must take to reach the exit (note: enemies cannot pass through towers). Every time an enemy reaches the exit, a life is deducted from the player's life count. If this count drops to zero, the game ends, and the player can opt to restart.

## Menu Access

At any point during the game, players can access a menu to either restart the game or exit it.
